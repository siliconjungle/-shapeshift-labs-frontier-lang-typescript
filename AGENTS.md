# Frontier Lang TypeScript Agent Notes

- Keep runtime imports dependency-light and package-boundary explicit.
- Do not commit release credentials, npm tokens, .env files, temporary npm configs, generated tarballs, node_modules, dist, or agent-runs.
- Preserve the package role documented in README; target-specific adapters should not leak into the kernel.
- Use npm test and npm pack --dry-run before publishing.
